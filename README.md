01_Foundations
This is the foundational branch of the mathematics journal. Here it will have the fundamentals covering linear algebra and other areas of maths pertinent to Machine Learning. This list will be updated as and when the notebooks get expanded.

* Workbook has gone through matrices, orthogonal matrices, spectral decomposition, and now starting on SVD. This will form the back bone of the workbook for now. 

This is the research journal documenting the mathematical underpinning of my project and wider ML theory.
