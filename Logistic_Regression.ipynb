        "This notebook is looking at the mathematics and theory that underpins linear regression models. Linear regression models are an algorithm that is used in classification problems. A traditional linear equation will not work in a classification problem because a linear regression model will provide an output that ranges from negative to positive infinity whereas a probability needs to be between 0-1. Therefore to do this, we have to apply a sigmoid transformation in order to ensure an output that will allow for probability problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "The sigmoid function is what changes a simple linear regression function into a logistic regression function that outputs in a 0-1 format rather than a negative infinity - postitive infinity scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "The way the sigmoid function works is in the $e^{-z}$ which dictates whether the overall function is a very small number or very large number. For example"
