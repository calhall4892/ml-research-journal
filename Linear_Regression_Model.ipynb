        "Linear Regression is a type of supervised algorithm that uses labelled data, consisting of input features ($X_{train}$) and their corresponding true values ($y_{train}$). The goal is to learn the most optimised linear function that can then be applied and used to predict the value ($\\hat{y}$) on a new, unseen dataset ($X_{test}$).\n",
